# Substrate

- The Substrate package contains the substrate class and has functions associated with using the entropy chain (which is built with substrate)
- The Substrate class also contains a WS connection and API object with the entropy chain that can be access directly (see polkadot.js for more documentation on that)

## Examples

### Setup

```js
const privateKey =
  '0xe5be9a5092b81bca64be81d212e7f2f9eba183bb7a90954f7b76361f6edb5c0a'
const chainEndPoint = 'ws://127.0.0.1:9944'

const substrate = await Substrate.setup(privateKey, chainEndpoint)
```

### Accessing the underlying api object

```js
const api = substrate.api
```

## Substrate Read

- If you only need access to reading the chain and don't require writing to it you can launch the SubstrateRead class which does not require a private key

```js
const chainEndPoint = 'ws://127.0.0.1:9944'
const substrateRead = await SubstrateRead.setup(chainEndpoint)
```
