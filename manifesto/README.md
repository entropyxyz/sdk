## SYSTEM OF BELIEF:

Personal and codding practices to live by:

- Take at least an "hour of joy" every day whatever that means to you just not writing more code
  go out side and hug a tree or something like that. A well rounded developer is one that participates in life.

- Commit often and always
  `wips: [context_here]` are great things it allows others to see what you are doing.

- Push up your branch At the end of your day and always look to see what should be pulled in the morning
  `git pull origin` :yellow_heart:

  > Git pull vs fetch: What's the difference?
  > The key difference between git fetch and pull is that git pull copies changes from a remote repository directly into your working directory, while git fetch does not. The git fetch command only copies changes into your local Git repo. The git pull command does both.

  if you are going to `fetch` don't forget the context your missing.
